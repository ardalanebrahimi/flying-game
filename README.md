# Rocket Adventure Game

A fun and engaging game where players control a rocket to navigate through different stages of the universe, avoiding obstacles and striving to reach deep space.

---

## Features

- **Stages**:
  - Earth Surface: Navigate through falling trees.
  - Sky: Dodge volcanic eruptions.
  - Outer Space: Avoid moving planets.
  - Deep Space: Escape fast-moving stars.
- **Realistic Physics**:
  - Gravity and thrust mechanics.
  - Deceleration in zero-gravity zones.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**:
  - Speed and difficulty adjust based on the stage.
  - Randomly spawning obstacles.
- **Explosions**:
  - Collide with obstacles to trigger an explosion effect.
  - Game pauses after collision; players can reset manually.

## Controls

- **Desktop**:
  - Use the mouse to click for thrust.
  - Press `ArrowLeft` or `A` to move left.
  - Press `ArrowRight` or `D` to move right.
- **Mobile**:
  - Tap the left or right edges of the screen to move horizontally.
  - Tap anywhere to apply thrust.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Android Studio installed for building and running the Android app.
- Capacitor CLI installed globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @capacitor/cli
  ```
````

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rocket-adventure-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rocket-adventure-game
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running the Game

### Development Server

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

---

## Build for Android

To build and deploy the app for Android devices:

### Steps:

1. **Build the production version of the app:**

   ```bash
   ng build --configuration production
   ```

   This generates the production-ready web app in the `dist/` folder.

2. **Copy the build to Capacitor:**

   ```bash
   npx cap copy
   ```

3. **Open the Android project in Android Studio:**

   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```

4. **Build and Run the App**:
   - In Android Studio, click `Run` to install and run the app on an emulator or connected device.

## Development

### Code Structure

- **Components**:
  - `GameComponent`: Main gameplay logic and rendering.
- **Services**:
  - `GameService`: Manages game state and player logic.
  - `PhysicsService`: Handles physics calculations like gravity and thrust.
  - `ObstacleService`: Spawns and manages obstacles.

### Key Methods

- `applyGravity`: Applies gravity and deceleration to the rocket.
- `spawnObstacle`: Spawns obstacles based on the current stage.
- `checkCollisions`: Detects collisions between the rocket and obstacles.

### Customization

- **Adjust Stages**: Modify stage properties (e.g., gravity, max speed) in `StageService`.
- **Add Obstacles**: Extend `ObstacleService` to include new obstacle types.

---

## Known Issues

- **Collision Detection**: Improvements may be needed for edge cases.
- **Performance**: Optimizations for a large number of dots and obstacles are ongoing.
